            <h1>Peaky Blinders</h1>
            <p>We're more than just a crew—we're a tight-knit family that stands up for each other when it counts but mostly loves to kick back and have a great time. Newbies and veterans alike are welcome!</p>
            
            <h2>What is in it for you</h2>
            <h3>Squad Activities</h3>
            <p>We’ve got your back in crew events, shootouts, money-making missions, and even party nights. We know how to throw down!</p>
            
            <h3>Good Vibes Only</h3>
            <p>We’re all about having fun while respecting the CNR rules (gotta keep things smooth, right?).</p>
            
            <h3>Help for new players</h3>
            <p>New to CnR? Then we are a perfect crew. Helping and caring is as important to us anything else.</p>
